Category Theory in Isabelle/HOL
===================

> Some additional libraries for Category Theory -- based upon [Alexander Katovsky's mechanization](http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Category2.shtml) -- in Isabelle/HOL

This project is now deprecated and abandoned. Several restrictions of the initial mechanization do not allow to properly define functors composition. In particular, handling `undefined` constant is necessary and requires to change the entire initial mechanized theory.
